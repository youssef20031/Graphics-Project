This project was created as part of the DMET 502: Computer Graphics course at the German University in Cairo. 
It uses OpenGL with imported models and textures. Thousands of lines of code were written and partitioned into many files in order to maintain clean code.

The gameplay is that of a 3D platformer with 2 levels, with a theme based on fire and ice. 
There are lots of platforming sections as well as traps to avoid such as swinging axes.

Controls: WASD to move. Spacebar to jump. Arrow keys to control camera.
